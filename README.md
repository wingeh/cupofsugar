# Cup of Sugar

# Description 

Concerned about the amount of food that is wasted everyday, we have created Cup of Sugar as a means to help. This app lets people post products that they would like to get rid of. Perhaps they bought too much of something that they don't want to go bad, or maye they grew something and would like to share their harvest. Cup of sugar would be the app for them. Simple to use, it provides users with a list of products that others have posted, they can then message them to help facilitate the exchange.   

# Walk-Through

1. When a user first navigate to our app, they are greeted with our main "Newsfeed" which contains a list of all products that are available. They are also presetned with two buttons, one to login and the other to register.

5. Each of our product card has a "Send Meassage" button. When the user clicks this they are taken to a message form that when submitted will add a message object to the database. Which a user can see by going to their message page.
